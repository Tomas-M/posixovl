Overview of posixovl file translation.


logical file  := file as seen in the posixovl mount
physical file := file as seen in the lower mount


Summary

State 0:
	* dentry "hello.txt" represented using "hello.txt"
	* inode contents stored in "hello.txt"
	* inode metadata synthesized
State 1:
	* dentry "hello.txt" represented using "hello.txt"
	* inode contents stored in "hello.txt"
	* inode metadata stored in ".pxovl.hello.txt"
State 2:
	* dentry "hello.txt" represented using "hello.txt" of size 0 and
	  ".pxovl.hello.txt" containing "type S_IFLNK|S_ISVTX" (acts as
	  S_IFHARDLINK) and the mention of ".pxovd.1234567890".
	* inode metadata stored in ".pxovn.1234567890"
	* inode contents stored in ".pxovd.1234567890"


State 0 - plain map

* A single logical file or directory is represented in the lower
  filesystem as a single file as well. For one logical file there is
  exactly one physical file. (For example, "/posixovl/hello.txt" <-->
  "/lower/hello.txt").

* The file name in the lower filesystem may be encoded in an
  implementation-specific fashion. There is a 1:1 (bijective) mapping
  between logical filename and the filename of the physical file
  holding the file contents. (For example, "/posixovl/hello*.txt"
  <--> "/lower/hello%(2A).txt".)

  (N.B.: The posixovl mount program implementation does not handle
  all of the awkward corner cases. In particular, it does not try to
  hide modifications outside of posixovl that would violate the
  bijective property.)

* The POSIX attributes shown in the logical filesystem are
  unspecified and implementation-specific. (The posixovl mount
  program will try to produce something sensible.)

* POSIX attributes cannot be changed in state 0. (If this is
  attempted, the mount program will create a HCB and transition the
  file to state 1.)

* The hardlink count cannot be changed in state 0. (The mount program
  will advance the file to state 1.)


State 1 - metadata present

* HCB is the "hidden control block", a companion file in the lower
  filesystem storing file type, permissions, owner/group, rdev,
  symlink target, etc.

* For each logical object, there will be two physical files
  (the file with the contents and the HCB metadata file).

* Like in state 0, there is a 1:1 mapping between a logical filename
  and the filename of the physical file holding the contents.

* There is a 1:1 mapping between a logical filename and the filename
  of the HCB file.

* For non-directories, the HCB is stored in parallel to the physical
  file, for example "/lower/hello.txt" <-->
  "/lower/.pxovl.hello.txt". Encoding rules apply as well, e.g.
  "/lower/hello.txt" <--> "/lower/.pxovl.hello%(2A).txt".

* For directories, the HCB is stored within the directory that it
  describes, for example "/lower/pictures" <-->
  "/lower/pictures/.pxovl.".

* Deleting the logical file or directory will delete both content
  file and the HCB file (as expected).

* The hardlink count cannot be changed in state 1.
  (If this is attempted, the mount program will do a conversion and
  advance the file to state 2.)

* There is no way back to state 0. (Other than perhaps manual
  modifications in the lower filesystem outside of posixovl.)


State 2 - data in a separate node

* Directories have no state 2 defined, because it is not permitted to
  hardlink them anyway.

* The contents of a logical file are stored in a separate physical
  file, "/lower/.pxovd.1234567890" (a random unique number is
  chosen), and the inode metadata such as owner/group and permissions
  is stored in "/lower/.pxovn.1234567890" (same number that was
  chosen for the pxovd file).

* A dentry such as "/posixovl/foo.txt" is represented using a
  zero-sized file "/lower/foo.txt" and a metadata file
  "/lower/.pxovl.foo.txt", the latter of which specifies file type
  S_IFLNK|S_ISVTX (121000) to indicate a hardlink, and with the
  target set to ".pxovd.1234567890".

  (N.B.: They are implemented quite like symlinks, which differ
  only in the file type.)

* Deleting the dentry will delete both the 0-sized placeholder file
  and its HCB ("/lower/foo.txt" and "/lower/.pxovl.foo.txt" in our
  example).

* Deleting the last reference (as determined by looking at the link
  count field in the pxovn file) will eliminate the pxovd and pxovn
  files.

* There is no way back to state 1.
