Usage:
	mount.vfat-x /vfat [fuseopts] /mnt

Supports:
	chmod
	chown
	mkfifo
	mknod
	symlink/readlink

Does not support:
	ACLs/xattrs
	Hard links

Terminology:
	Real file:                  /source/foo.txt
	Hidden control block (HCB): /source/.vfatx.foo.txt
	Virtual file:               /target/foo.txt

Notes:
	If no HCB exists for a file or directory, the default permissions are
	644 and 755, respectively. The owner and group of the inode will be the
	owner/group of the real file.

	Each non-regular, non-directory virtual file will have a zero-size real
	file. (Simplifies handling, and makes it apprarent the object exists
	when using other OS.)
