Usage:
	mount.posixovl /vfat [fuseopts] /mnt

Supports:
	chmod
	chown
	mkfifo
	mknod
	symlink/readlink

Does not support:
	ACLs/xattrs

Terminology:
	L0 file: /foo.txt
	L0 HCB:  /.pxovl.foo.txt
	L1 file: /.pxovd.ID (sometimes called the HL.D-node)
	L1 HCB:  /.pxovn.ID (sometimes called the HL.I-node)

Notes:
	Do not use the umask= mount option on the underlying filesystem. 
	posixovl assumes the default umask of 0022. Permissions will leak if
	you do not follow this (e.g. files may have "a +w bit too much for your
	security"). You do not need the umask= mount option on the underlying
	filesystem! Giving write permission inside the posixovl mount is the
	proper way.

	If no HCB exists for a file or directory, the default permissions are
	644 and 755, respectively. The owner and group of the inode will be the
	owner/group of the real file.

	Each non-regular, non-directory virtual file will have a zero-size real
	file. (Simplifies handling, and makes it apprarent the object exists
	when using other OS.)

	`df` will show:
	$ df -Tah
	Filesystem    Type    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
	/dev/hda5     vfat    5.9G  2.1G  3.9G  35% /D
	posix-overlay fuse    5.9G  2.1G  3.9G  35% /D
